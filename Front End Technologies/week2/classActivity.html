        <p id="hoverText"><b>Harp seals</b> are foraging predators that eat several 
            dozen species of bony fishes and invertebrates. They
            will eat just about anything they can catch. <i>Juveniles</i> eat 
            krill and other pelagic crustaceans, and the diet diversifies as 
            they grow. Adult harp seals are eaten by killer whales and large sharks. 
            Juveniles are eaten by polar bears and other terrestrial predators, 
            including foxes and wolves.</p>
            <p>Courtship <br>among harp seals takes place on the ice surface, but mating typically occurs in the water. Both males and females may mate with several partners during the mating season. Like all mammals, harp seals reproduce via internal fertilization and give birth to live young. Pups are born on the ice surface and are nursed by their mothers for only 12 days. After the nursing period, the pup is still quite helpless and unable to hunt for several weeks. During that time, it derives energy from its fat reserves, may lose up to 50% of its body weight, and is particularly vulnerable to predators.</p>
