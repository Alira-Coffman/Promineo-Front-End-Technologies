    <p>Power Rangers is an American entertainment and merchandising franchise built 
        around a live-action superhero television series, based on the Japanese 
        tokusatsu franchise Super Sentai. Produced first by Saban Entertainment, 
        second by BVS Entertainment, later by Saban Brands, and today by SCG Power 
        Rangers LLC and its parent company, Hasbro, the Power Rangers television 
        series takes much of its footage from the Super Sentai television series, 
        produced by Toei Company.[1] The first Power Rangers entry, Mighty Morphin 
        Power Rangers, debuted on August 28, 1993, and helped launch the Fox Kids 
        programming block of the 1990s, during which it catapulted into popular culture 
        along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai.[2] By 2001, the media franchise had generated over $6 billion in toy sales.[3]</p>
